Hi 👋, my name is Moa. I write ✍🏼 about open source, programming, automation, and everything in between. Check out [my blog posts](/blog).

<LinksSection />
<br />

I architect systems, make websites 🧑🏽‍💻 and build applications. I use Node.js, React, and Kubernetes. I love good design, and I'm a Google certified Associate Cloud Engineer.

I interface 📣 between technical and non-technical audiences, backend and frontend, infrastructure and design, policy and engineering.

I’m passionate about DX, simplifying infrastructure, and striking balance between form and function. I’m also a keen [photographer](/photos) 📷
and seasoned project manager.

I’m currently working from Recife <Weather />. If you’re around, reach out. Let’s meet for a coffee ☕️ and get some work done together.
