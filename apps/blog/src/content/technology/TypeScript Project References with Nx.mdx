  title: 'TypeScript Project References in Nx',
}

TypeScript project references are a powerful feature that enables incremental builds and better type-checking across multiple projects in a monorepo. When combined with Nx, a smart build system for monorepos, they can significantly improve developer productivity and build performance.

## What Are TypeScript Project References?

TypeScript project references allow you to structure your codebase into smaller, manageable projects that can reference each other. Each project has its own `tsconfig.json` file, and TypeScript can build these projects incrementally, only rebuilding what has changed.

## Benefits in Nx Monorepos

Nx enhances the use of TypeScript project references by providing tools to manage dependencies, caching, and build orchestration. Some key benefits include:

- **Faster Builds:** Nx leverages TypeScript's incremental builds and its own caching mechanism to speed up builds.
- **Improved Type Safety:** TypeScript ensures type-checking across project boundaries, reducing runtime errors.
- **Clear Dependency Management:** Nx's dependency graph helps visualize and manage relationships between projects.

## Setting Up TypeScript Project References in Nx

1. **Enable Project References:** Add the `references` property in the `tsconfig.json` of each project to reference its dependencies.
2. **Update Nx Configuration:** Ensure that Nx's `project.json` or `workspace.json` reflects the correct dependencies.
3. **Run Builds:** Use Nx commands like `nx build` to build projects incrementally.

## Conclusion

TypeScript project references, when used with Nx, provide a robust solution for managing large monorepos. They improve build times, enforce type safety, and simplify dependency management, making them an essential tool for modern TypeScript development.
